# YaManicBot

I wanted a bot to do some things that I want. 

I decided to fork pokemontrades/porygon-bot because I knew how it works and it already worked well with IRC. 

## Features

(todo once I have features different from porygon-bot)

## Pre-requisites

* Node 6+ ([node installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager))
* NPM or Yarn ([yarn installation instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install))

Note: we recommend yarn due to it's improved caching and more reliable dependency installs, however npm should work just fine for the majority of people.

## Installation
* `yarn` or `npm install`
* `mv config.default.js config.js`
* edit config.js and update information

## Usage
* With Yarn:
```
yarn start
```
* With NPM:
```
npm start
```
